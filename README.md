The Grand Delight is a South African owned restaurant. I built this website as a solution to provide a platform for customers to make reservations and also order food online. Most if not all high end restaurant do not provide the option of ordering food online, I have been in conversations with many people and they all thought it would be a good idea and benefit for both the restaurant and customers. The web app uses stripe for payments and also uses Querying API for live data and local data storage.
