Little Lemon is owned by two Italian brothers, Mario and Adrian, who moved to the United States to pursue their shared dream of owning a restaurant. To craft the menu, Mario relies on family recipes and his experience as a chef in Italy. I built this website as an assignment to provide a platform for customers to make reservations and also order food online. The web app uses stripe for payments and also uses Querying API for live data and local data storage.
